## Information

This forked version of JumpCutter is designed to run more efficiently and jumpcut videos faster, along with a bit more simplicity. It should be noted that it may take a long time for the jumpcutter to finish, depending on your computer's hardware.

It is strongly recommended to check the duriation of the video before attempting to jumpcut. The longer the video, the more space it could take up, as it exports every frame in the video as a **.jpg** image file.
